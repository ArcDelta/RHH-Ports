## How to play
- You have 25 ingame days to find and destroy all enemy ships
- Use long range sensors to scan a few surrounding grid coordinates for [e][b][s] (enemies, bases, stars)
- Warp to sectors with enemy ships to confront them
- Raise shields and either use phasers (weaker, auto attack) by adjusting power level or torpedos for a ohko if it lands a hit
- Repair damaged ship at starbases by using impulse power to move adjacent to them and initiating docking
- Repeat process until you either get blown up, run out of time, or win by destroying all enemy ships

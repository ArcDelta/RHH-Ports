## Installation
This port of Hollow Knight: Silksong uses the Linux game assets with Box64. Wine is not involved. Copy your game assets to the `data` folder.

## Requirements
You must be using a device with desktop OpenGL and have access to x11. Hollow Knight: Silksong with Box64 was tested on Rocknix RPMini and RPFlip2. These are mainline linux devices.

Hollow Knight: Silksong was designed to maintain its 16:9 aspect ratio. This cannot be changed.

## Notes

The D-PAD is currently inverted (up is down, left is right etc). The joystick works as expected.

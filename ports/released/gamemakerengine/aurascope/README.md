## Installation
This is a port for the DEMO!!

Download the DEMO at https://store.steampowered.com/app/1547880/Aurascope/ or https://nick64.itch.io/aurascope and add all the data to `ports/aurascope/assets`.

If you enjoy the demo, visit the [Kickstarter Page](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/aurascope/aurascope) to follow the game and back the developer!

PortMaster has no affiliation or partnership with the Aurascope Team and we CANNOT guarantee the full game will become a port once released.

This port is currently marked `ultra` due to cpu usage. Slowdowns occur even on RK3566 with fps dips to low 30s, but you are welcome to manually install anyway to see for yourself.

You can modify the `Aurascope.sh` file to use a gptk file instead of the xbox360 virtual controller, simply comment the alternate line. When using the gptk file, pressing X will give you a FPS overlay in the bottom left of the screen.

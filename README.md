# Jeod's Ports
You can use [Downgit](https://downgit.github.io/#/home) to download specific folders in this repository without having to clone the whole thing.

Whether you're new to retro handhelds, a developer who came across this repository and noticed their game has a port, or a developer seeking information, I can't recommend enough this video by WULFF DEN which encapsulates the whole idea pretty well.

## Contributing
If you see potential for improvements to my ports, I'm open to suggestions and pull requests--especially for unreleased ports, which are either in testing with the PortMaster Discord server or in limbo for one reason or another. Please do not open issues to suggest new ports unless you're certain they can be ported. Although, if you're certain a game can be ported, why not do it yourself?

Please review the [Contribution Guidelines](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) before proceeding with contributions.

## Donating
I love bringing indie games to the linux arm64 platform, and seeing people experience games through a new medium! Making legal ports with commercial indie games isn't free though. I accept donations on my [Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/jeodc) page. All donations I receive go towards further port research -- mostly purchasing commercial games to develop new ports with.

## Licensing
All of these port wrappers are MIT licensed except for the following:

- Game assets as a part of "ready to run" ports are licensed for distribution through PortMaster, but the MIT license does *not* apply to the assets.
- Open source tools like [GMLoader-Next](https://github.com/PortsMaster/gmloader-next?tab=readme-ov-file) and [GMTools](https://github.com/cdeletre/gmtools) have their own licenses and are not necessarily MIT.
- Open source projects like Ship of Harkinian may also have their own licenses.
- Libraries used by the ports have their own licenses.

In short, the MIT license applies only to custom parts of the port wrappers, typically the bash files.

# Jeod's PortMaster Ports
=========================

This repository should be considered to be either the "nightly" repository for my ports or a mirror for them. For published, curated releases please see [PortMaster-New](https://github.com/PortsMaster/PortMaster-New) and [PortMaster-MV-New](https://github.com/PortsMaster-MV/PortMaster-MV-New). I *strongly* advise using the releases from those two repositories. If you absolutely want to use a nightly port-in-progress, perhaps for testing or to help with development, you can use [Downgit](https://downgit.github.io/#/home) to download specific folders in this repository without having to clone the whole thing.

As with PortMaster, all of these port wrappers are MIT licensed except for the following:

- Game assets as a part of "ready to run" ports are licensed for distribution through PortMaster, but the MIT license does *not* apply to the assets.
- Open source tools like [GMLoader-Next](https://github.com/PortsMaster/gmloader-next?tab=readme-ov-file) and [GMTools](https://github.com/cdeletre/gmtools) have their own licenses and are not necessarily MIT.
- Open source projects like Ship of Harkinian may also have their own licenses.
- Libraries used by the ports have their own licenses.

In short, the MIT license applies only to custom parts of the port wrappers, typically the bash files.

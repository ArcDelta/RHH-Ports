# Jeod's PortMaster Ports
This repository should be considered to be either the "nightly" repository for my ports or a mirror for them. For published, curated releases please see [PortMaster-New](https://github.com/PortsMaster/PortMaster-New) and [PortMaster-MV-New](https://github.com/PortsMaster-MV/PortMaster-MV-New). I *strongly* advise using the releases from those two repositories. If you absolutely want to use a nightly port-in-progress, perhaps for testing or to help with development, you can use [Downgit](https://downgit.github.io/#/home) to download specific folders in this repository without having to clone the whole thing.

## Contributing
If you see potential for improvements to my ports, I'm open to suggestions and pull requests--especially for unreleased ports, which are either in testing with the PortMaster Discord server or in limbo for one reason or another. Please do not open issues to suggest new ports unless you're certain they can be ported. Although, if you're certain a game can be ported, why not do it yourself?

## Donating
I accept donations on my Ko-Fi page. All donations I receieve go towards further port research -- mostly purchasing commercial games to develop new ports with.

## Licensing
As with PortMaster, all of these port wrappers are MIT licensed except for the following:

- Game assets as a part of "ready to run" ports are licensed for distribution through PortMaster, but the MIT license does *not* apply to the assets.
- Open source tools like [GMLoader-Next](https://github.com/PortsMaster/gmloader-next?tab=readme-ov-file) and [GMTools](https://github.com/cdeletre/gmtools) have their own licenses and are not necessarily MIT.
- Open source projects like Ship of Harkinian may also have their own licenses.
- Libraries used by the ports have their own licenses.

In short, the MIT license applies only to custom parts of the port wrappers, typically the bash files.

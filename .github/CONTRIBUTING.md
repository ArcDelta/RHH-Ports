## :bulb: Asking Questions

For questions and help with running these ports, you can find me on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/JeodPM). Questions about ports are welcome, however simple questions should not be made into GitHub Issues.

## :inbox_tray: Opening an Issue

Before creating an issue, check if you are using the latest version of the port(s) in question. If you are not up-to-date, see if updating fixes your issue first.

### :lock: Reporting Security Issues

Bear in mind the systems these ports use are generally rooted. The root user is always used and therefore almost anything is possible. If you spot a script that has the potential to be damaging under certain conditions, please report it.

### :beetle: Bug Reports and Other Issues

A great way to contribute is to send a detailed issue when you encounter a problem. Everyone appreciates a well-written, thorough bug report.

- ** Do not open issues for ports outside of this repository!** This repository is for my own ports, that I authored. I am happy to help with other ports, but for the sake of organization please ask for help in the [PortMaster Discord](https://discord.gg/JxYBp9HTAY).

- **Do not open a duplicate issue!** Search through existing issues to see if your issue has previously been reported. If your issue exists, comment with any additional information you have. You may simply note "I have this problem too", which helps prioritize the most common problems and requests.

- **Prefer using [reactions](https://github.blog/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/)**, not comments, if you simply want to "+1" an existing issue.

- **Fully complete the provided issue template.** The bug report template requests all the information we need to quickly and efficiently address your issue. Be clear, concise, and descriptive. Provide as much information as you can, including steps to reproduce, stack traces, compiler errors, library versions, OS versions, and screenshots (if applicable).

- **Use [GitHub-flavored Markdown](https://help.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).** Especially put code blocks and console outputs in backticks. This improves readability.

## :repeat: Submitting Pull Requests

Once again this repository is for ports that I authored. Please do not attempt pull requests for new ports; they will be closed and ignored. Pull requests should be for modifications to existing ports, either released or unreleased, and clearly explain the reason for the modifications.

Before [forking the repo](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) and [creating a pull request](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests) for non-trivial changes, it is usually best to first open an issue to discuss the changes, or discuss your intended approach for solving the problem in the comments for an existing issue.

*Note: All contributions will be licensed under the project's license.*

- **Smaller is better.** Submit **one** pull request per bug fix or feature. A pull request should contain isolated changes pertaining to a single bug fix or feature implementation. **Do not** refactor or reformat code that is unrelated to your change. It is better to **submit many small pull requests** rather than a single large one. Enormous pull requests will take enormous amounts of time to review, or may be rejected altogether.
- **Coordinate bigger changes.** For large and non-trivial changes, open an issue to discuss a strategy with the maintainers. Otherwise, you risk doing a lot of work for nothing!
- **Prioritize understanding over cleverness.** Write code clearly and concisely. Remember that source code usually gets written once and read often. Ensure the code is clear to the reader. The purpose and logic should be obvious to a reasonably skilled developer, otherwise you should add a comment that explains it.
- When writing comments, use properly constructed sentences, including punctuation.

## :white_check_mark: Code Review
- **Review the code, not the author.** Look for and suggest improvements without disparaging or insulting the author. Provide actionable feedback and explain your reasoning.
- **You are not your code.** When your code is critiqued, questioned, or constructively criticized, remember that you are not your code. Do not take code review personally.
- **Always do your best.** No one writes bugs on purpose. Do your best, and learn from your mistakes.
- Kindly note any violations to the guidelines specified in this document.
